      I consider myself responsible, committed, proactive, empathetic, analytical, results-oriented, with strong skills for building relationships, as well as for oral and written communication. I have developed skills in problem solving and project execution in various areas at a local and global level, as well as leadership skills for multidisciplinary and multicultural teams. I have a sense of urgency and a great desire to learn (self-taught). I have self-management skills and teamwork skills. In recent years I have been involved in the prioritization and management of the development backlog of digital solutions and operational requirements in the digital E-commerce industry, with a high focus on customer needs and an omnichannel vision. I have experience in the operation and implementation of developments in E-commerce platforms such as VTEX and Magento Cloud (Adobe Commerce). I have worked using project management tools like Jira and Asana. I am an Ad Honorem member of the IESA Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Caracas - Venezuela), so I have knowledge of agile methodologies and innovation tools such as Design Thinking, Lean Start-up, Business Model Canvas, Scrum, Kanban, among others.

I enjoy data analysis and interpretation of economic and market information that allows finding insights and unmet needs, in order to generate proposals that increase value for clients and companies. I am interested in technology, applications (Apps) and digital products. I am motivated by great challenges, Startups and generating impact.
